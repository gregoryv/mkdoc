§1 Introduction

Documenting concepts and ideas using plain text documents.  In
particular in software design, specifications need to be concise and
correct.

§1.1 Purpose

Specify minimal format rules to plain text documents which enables
developers to use simple processing tools when producing the final
document. The final document in this context is a preformatted HTML
file.

§2 Format Rules

The rules are meant to aid writers in maintaining focus on their
content.

§2.1 Links

Sections SHOULD start with the § sign followed by a level and a
heading (#R1).

    §9.1.5 Example Heading

Section links SHOULD be written within parentheses (#R2).

    "... link format rules (&sect;2.1)."

When processing the § sign SHOULD be replaced with the word
'section' (#R3).

    "... links (§2.1) ..."

Plain links SHOULD be written within square brackets and URL's
defined at the end of a document (#R4). Each line in the links file
SHOULD read "[Text]: URL" (#R5).

Example:

    ... [example.com] ...

Reference links SHOULD be written within square brackets (#R5).

    "... see [1]."
