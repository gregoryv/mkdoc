§1 Introduction

Documenting concepts and ideas using plain text documents.  In
particular in software design, specifications need to be concise and
correct.

§1.1 Purpose

Specify minimal format rules to plain text documents which enables
developers to use processing tools, like [mkdoc], when producing the
final document. The final document in this context is a preformatted
HTML file.

§1.2 Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119] [1].
   
§2 Format Rules

The rules are meant to aid writers in maintaining focus on their
content.

§2.1 Sections

Sections SHOULD(#R1) start with the § sign followed by a level and a
heading.

    §9.1.5 Example Heading

§2.2 Links

Section links SHOULD(#R2) be written within parentheses.

    "... link format rules (&sect;2.1)."

When processing the § sign SHOULD(#R3) be replaced with the word
'section'.

    "... links (§2.1) ..."

Plain links SHOULD(#R4) be written within square brackets. URL's of
those links SHOULD(#R5) be defined on separate lines. Preferably at the
end of a document. 

Example:  "&lbrack;example.com&rbrack;: https://example.com".

    ... [example.com] ...

Reference links SHOULD(#R6) be written within square brackets.

    "... see [1]."

Requirement links SHOULD(#R7) be written within parenthesis and start with
#R followed by a number.

Example: &lpar;#R7&rpar;
